                CORS is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one domain to access resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a security restriction known as same-origin policy that prevents a web page from
                calling APIs in a different domain; CORS provides a secure way to allow one domain (the origin domain) to call APIs in another domain

      permanently removed. Use the List Blobs API and specify the "include=deleted" query parameter to discover which blobs and snapshots have been soft deleted. You can then use the Undelete Blob API to restore a soft-deleted blob. All
      other operations on a soft-deleted blob or snapshot causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound). If the storage account's automatic snapshot feature is enabled, then, when a blob is deleted, an automatic
      snapshot is created. The blob becomes inaccessible immediately. All other operations on the blob causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound). You can access automatic snapshot using snapshot timestamp or

          The Commit Block List operation writes a blob by specifying the list of block IDs that make up the blob. In order to be written as part of a blob, a block must have been successfully written to the server in a prior Put Block
          operation. You can call Put Block List to update a blob by uploading only those blocks that have changed, then committing the new and existing blocks together. You can do this by specifying whether to commit a block from the
          committed block list or from the uncommitted block list, or to commit the most recently uploaded version of the block, whichever list it may belong to.
