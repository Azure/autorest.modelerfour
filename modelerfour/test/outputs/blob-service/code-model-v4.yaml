                CORS is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one domain to access resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a security restriction known as same-origin policy that prevents a web page from
                calling APIs in a different domain; CORS provides a secure way to allow one domain (the origin domain) to call APIs in another domain
