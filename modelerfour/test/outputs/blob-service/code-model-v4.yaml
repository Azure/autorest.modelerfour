      If the storage account's soft delete feature is disabled then, when a blob is deleted, it is permanently removed from the storage account. If the storage account's soft delete feature is enabled, then, when a blob is deleted, it is
      marked for deletion and becomes inaccessible immediately. However, the blob service retains the blob or snapshot for the number of days specified by the DeleteRetentionPolicy section of [Storage service properties]
      (Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md). After the specified number of days has passed, the blob's data is permanently removed from the storage account. Note that you continue to be charged for the soft-deleted blob's storage until it is
      permanently removed. Use the List Blobs API and specify the "include=deleted" query parameter to discover which blobs and snapshots have been soft deleted. You can then use the Undelete Blob API to restore a soft-deleted blob. All
      other operations on a soft-deleted blob or snapshot causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound). If the storage account's automatic snapshot feature is enabled, then, when a blob is deleted, an automatic
      snapshot is created. The blob becomes inaccessible immediately. All other operations on the blob causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound). You can access automatic snapshot using snapshot timestamp or
      version id. You can restore the blob by calling Put or Copy Blob API with automatic snapshot as source. Deleting automatic snapshot requires shared key or special SAS/RBAC permissions.

          is marked for deletion and becomes inaccessible immediately. However, the blob service retains the blob or snapshot for the number of days specified by the DeleteRetentionPolicy section of [Storage service properties]
          (Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md). After the specified number of days has passed, the blob's data is permanently removed from the storage account. Note that you continue to be charged for the soft-deleted blob's storage until it is
          permanently removed. Use the List Blobs API and specify the "include=deleted" query parameter to discover which blobs and snapshots have been soft deleted. You can then use the Undelete Blob API to restore a soft-deleted blob. All
          other operations on a soft-deleted blob or snapshot causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound). If the storage account's automatic snapshot feature is enabled, then, when a blob is deleted, an
          automatic snapshot is created. The blob becomes inaccessible immediately. All other operations on the blob causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound). You can access automatic snapshot using
          snapshot timestamp or version id. You can restore the blob by calling Put or Copy Blob API with automatic snapshot as source. Deleting automatic snapshot requires shared key or special SAS/RBAC permissions.

    description: >-
      Rename a blob/file.  By default, the destination is overwritten and if the destination already exists and has a lease the lease is broken.  This operation supports conditional HTTP requests.  For more information, see [Specifying
      Conditional Headers for Blob Service Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/storageservices/specifying-conditional-headers-for-blob-service-operations).  To fail if the destination already exists, use a conditional
      request with If-None-Match: "*".

      The Commit Block List operation writes a blob by specifying the list of block IDs that make up the blob. In order to be written as part of a blob, a block must have been successfully written to the server in a prior Put Block

      block list or from the uncommitted block list, or to commit the most recently uploaded version of the block, whichever list it may belong to.

          operation. You can call Put Block List to update a blob by uploading only those blocks that have changed, then committing the new and existing blocks together. You can do this by specifying whether to commit a block from the
          committed block list or from the uncommitted block list, or to commit the most recently uploaded version of the block, whichever list it may belong to.
