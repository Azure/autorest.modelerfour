                CORS is an HTTP feature that enables a web application running under one domain to access resources in another domain. Web browsers implement a security restriction known as same-origin policy that prevents a web page from
                calling APIs in a different domain; CORS provides a secure way to allow one domain (the origin domain) to call APIs in another domain

              Specifies the maximum number of containers to return. If the request does not specify maxresults, or specifies a value greater than 5000, the server will return up to 5000 items. Note that if the listing operation crosses a
              partition boundary, then the service will return a continuation token for retrieving the remainder of the results. For this reason, it is possible that the service will return fewer results than specified by maxresults, or
              than the default of 5000.

      If the storage account's soft delete feature is disabled then, when a blob is deleted, it is permanently removed from the storage account. If the storage account's soft delete feature is enabled, then, when a blob is deleted, it is
      marked for deletion and becomes inaccessible immediately. However, the blob service retains the blob or snapshot for the number of days specified by the DeleteRetentionPolicy section of [Storage service properties]
      (Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md). After the specified number of days has passed, the blob's data is permanently removed from the storage account. Note that you continue to be charged for the soft-deleted blob's storage until it is
      permanently removed. Use the List Blobs API and specify the "include=deleted" query parameter to discover which blobs and snapshots have been soft deleted. You can then use the Undelete Blob API to restore a soft-deleted blob. All
      other operations on a soft-deleted blob or snapshot causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound). If the storage account's automatic snapshot feature is enabled, then, when a blob is deleted, an automatic
      snapshot is created. The blob becomes inaccessible immediately. All other operations on the blob causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound). You can access automatic snapshot using snapshot timestamp or
      version id. You can restore the blob by calling Put or Copy Blob API with automatic snapshot as source. Deleting automatic snapshot requires shared key or special SAS/RBAC permissions.

          If the storage account's soft delete feature is disabled then, when a blob is deleted, it is permanently removed from the storage account. If the storage account's soft delete feature is enabled, then, when a blob is deleted, it
          is marked for deletion and becomes inaccessible immediately. However, the blob service retains the blob or snapshot for the number of days specified by the DeleteRetentionPolicy section of [Storage service properties]
          (Set-Blob-Service-Properties.md). After the specified number of days has passed, the blob's data is permanently removed from the storage account. Note that you continue to be charged for the soft-deleted blob's storage until it is
          permanently removed. Use the List Blobs API and specify the "include=deleted" query parameter to discover which blobs and snapshots have been soft deleted. You can then use the Undelete Blob API to restore a soft-deleted blob. All
          other operations on a soft-deleted blob or snapshot causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound). If the storage account's automatic snapshot feature is enabled, then, when a blob is deleted, an
          automatic snapshot is created. The blob becomes inaccessible immediately. All other operations on the blob causes the service to return an HTTP status code of 404 (ResourceNotFound). You can access automatic snapshot using
          snapshot timestamp or version id. You can restore the blob by calling Put or Copy Blob API with automatic snapshot as source. Deleting automatic snapshot requires shared key or special SAS/RBAC permissions.

              For a break operation, proposed duration the lease should continue before it is broken, in seconds, between 0 and 60. This break period is only used if it is shorter than the time remaining on the lease. If longer, the time
              remaining on the lease is used. A new lease will not be available before the break period has expired, but the lease may be held for longer than the break period. If this header does not appear with a break operation, a
              fixed-duration lease breaks after the remaining lease period elapses, and an infinite lease breaks immediately.
